## Dynamic Window Managers
What makes DWM different from i3? The first thing that may come to mind will likely be the process of patching a new feature into DWM, or editing your config through a header file. A philosophy around directness of software over usability; KISS at its truest. Is it simple to work with as a user? No. But it is *simple*.

Unfortunately this has nothing to do with what makes something a dynamic compositor. So what is *dynamic*?


## Tags

At first glance what you are seeing appears to be a workspace with two windows in it, Side by side. But this is a bit of a farce. If you notice, there are, instead 2 highlighted numbers for your "workspace" bar.

To work on this article I haven't created a special workspace for my workflow, but instead I have built it up from separate "tags". On demand. In these kinds of window managers tags allow you to dynamically view multiple windows from different tags at once, or you can treat tags exactly like workspaces and just switch to them one at a time.


## Tips for Good Submissions
- Use fenced code blocks (three backticks) for configs and commands.
- Add 1–2 screenshots (compressed PNG/JPEG/WebP is best).
- Include a one-sentence summary at the top and a few tags.
