## Why do i use Gentoo?
I use **Gentoo Linux** as my main distribution at the moment because its the one distro that doesn't cause me any problems + its pretty stable and i do like the fact that i have to compile everything and the performance boost that comes along with compiling everything for your specific hardware is pretty noticible!

## Why do i use qtile instead of Dwm, AwesomeWM, XMonad, etc..
I find qtile being a very fast window manager even tho its written in python which in theory should make it slow but it doesn't! + Qtile is a very customizable window manager by default and you also have more stuff to choose from **Qtile Extras**

## Why nord theme?
I choose nord theme because of the desaturated colors that are more easier on the eyes while working long hours.

## What do i use this setup for:
- School Work
- Watching Movies
- Learning

## Software i use on daily bases:
- Neovim (For Code Editing And Writing PDF's Using LaTeX)
- Alacritty (Terminal)
- Dmenu (App & Script Launcher)
- Firefox (Web Browser)
- Discord (Chatting)
- Spotify (Music)
- Ranger (Terminal File Browser)
- Thunar (GUI File Browser)

## Dependecies:
- python
- python-psutil
- qtile
- xorg
- libX11
- libXft
- libXinerama
